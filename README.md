Corescript is a bare-bones minimalist language designed  
to be a jump-start for people getting into computer programming.

Corescript is not a production language. It is a learning tool.  
You can write advanced things in Corescript by pushing it to it's  
limits, but not seriously.

## Hello World Example
To start off, let's look at a simple Corescript program.  
This is the classic "Hello, World" example.
```
print Hello, World!
```

Pretty easy, right? Good, let's move on to the next example.

## Variables
Variables can simply be declared by using:
```
var name = John
```

You *must* use a space between the equal sign, or the code will  
not work. And besides, it is easier to read that way.

To set a variable, use the `set` command.
```
set name = John Doe

```
