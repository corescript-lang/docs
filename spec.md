## January 2018
- (a new advanced web editor with syntax highlighting was made)
- `if`, `set`, `var`, and `not` can have spaces around the equal signs.  
Ex: `var name = Jim`
- Instead of spaces seperating string and line numbers in `if` and `not` statements,  
use `:`. Ex: `if name = Jim:42`
- Added labels. Define them with `:foo`. They can be used in place of line numbers.
- Comments start with `//` and end with newline
- Added build-in function `rand` (`print (rand 0 10)`)

## April 2020
